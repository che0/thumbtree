thumbtree.py is a Python script that takes a directory tree with pictures
and creates/updates a second tree to contain the same structure, but with
all photos scaled down to 1920x1200 and reduced quality.

It's useful if you have an archive of pictures you want to view on mobile
device with limited storage.

The script uses ImageMagick's convert script to do the hard work.
